* Org-Kasten

After reading SÃ¶hnke Ahrendt's /How To Take Smart Notes/ and going through a few
iterations of the paper-bound index card version I felt limited by the lack of
portability as soon as you had accumulated some cards. =org-mode= was alread 80%
there for the functionality I needed, so I hacked some features on top.

This is my attempt at making a functional /Exocortex/, or a structure to think
in that is outside of your fleshy containment cell.

Any such structure has to be oriented towards a specific goal, as sadly these
structures do not have the universality of our brains. This one in specific is
created towards writing and being able to quickly ingest lots of information,
with later being able to link it.

My personal experience has shown that no topics are too far apart that they will
not, over quite some connections and angles, relate to each other, meaning I am
in favour of concentrating as many knowledge nodes as you can create in one
single cortex.

This demands scalable tools, as, over time, your knowledge expands to domains
and topics you may not have even known exist. This needs to be accomodated. As
such I'm basing this on the most stable piece of software I know, Emacs, as well
as the most stable serialization format that I know, plain text.
