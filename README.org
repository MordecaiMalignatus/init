* Org-Kasten

This is a small set of elisp functions I use to implement my own version of a
Zettelkasten, something that HN is currently infatuated with.

** Structure
The org-kasten operates on a folder, with a "special" file named =0.org=. This
acts as the entry point and is hotkeyed to =C-# C-#=.


** Installation
1. Place somewhere on your Emacs loadpath. I symlink the repo to
   =~/.emacs.d/init/org-kasten.el=.
2. Add to your =init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(use-package org-kasten
  :config
  (setq org-kasten-home "/path/to/kasten/")
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-kasten-mode))
#+END_SRC
